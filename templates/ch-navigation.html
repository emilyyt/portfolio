<h1>Course Hero</h1>
<h2>Project 3: Navigation and Homepage Redesign</h2>
    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>
    While I was working on the rebranding project mid-2016, I continued to encounter the same app friction points navigating from one section of the app to another. For example, I remember feeling overwhelmed when I first landed on the home screen because six calls-to-action were presented to me before I could figue out what the app does. Other users coming from the website may easily share the same sentiment, especially if they are first-time Course Hero users. Secondly, Course Hero prides itself as being the go-to place for students to access and purchase study resources but our resources were hidden behind our search screen and our Course Hero-specific currencies were also not well represented during the resource-shopping process. I conducted several usability tests with non-Course Hero users to pinpoint these key friction points in their experience. We very quickly noticed students' confusion when they find a document they're interested in, only to be interrupted by a payment page that they didn't expect. The app wasn't presented in a way that helps our users understand how things work; seems like the app's information architecture needs work, but I didn't have enough information to back this claim.

    <p>
     I decided first, to propose tackling each friction point as separate issues. If small design changes can produce good results, a large-scale information architecture reorg would be unnecessary. The major problem areas I focused on include: 1) reduce the intimidation factor on the home screen and hamburger menu (our primary navigation tools) to help users understand where they are and where they want to go; 2) help users explore the content we have to offer, which we presume would increase the number of users who would unlock our resources.

    <p>Next, I moved on to rethink our search bar. Search is a functionality we want to heavily promote to help with content discovery, which would lead to increased content unlocks.

    <h3>Students vs. Course Hero</h3>

    <p>After working on the product for a while, I developed an increased understanding of our business goals and separately increased visibility to our student users. It became apparent that we weren't prioritizing what is most important to our students, although our long-term goals are aligned. </p>
    <div class="ch-vs-students">
        <ul class="student-goal">
            <li class="goal-heading">Student Goal</li>
            <li class="goal-description">Get good grades</li>
            <li class="action-heading">Want:</li>
            <li class="action-description">Access study materials quickly and easily</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ch-goal">
            <li class="goal-heading">Course Hero Goal</li>
            <li class="goal-description">Help students get good grades</li>
            <li class="action-heading">Areas of focus:</li>
            <li class="action-description">Increase collection of helpful student content</li>
            <li class="action-description">Improve content discovery</li>
            <li class="action-description">Provide study tools</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="caption"> Our team's primary focus: Increase collection of helpful student content </div>
    <img class="lazy" data-original="../static/build/images/ch-primary.png" alt="primary goal in app" width="100%"/>

    <img class="lazy" data-original="../static/build/images/ch-secondary.png" alt="secondary goal in app" width="100%"/>

    <img class="lazy" data-original="../static/build/images/ch-tertiary.png" alt="tertiary goal in app" width="100%"/>
    </p>
    <p>
    As displayed above, our company's goal aims to help students do better at school. However, our mobile app addressed each "area of focus" very literally. When evaluating the motivations of our student users, we found that Course Hero's primary focus (to collect study resources from our students) is not the priority of our users. Yet, 3 out of 6 CTAs on our home screen are dedicated directly at content creation. We dedicated large areas of the app to take users to create content, without providing them the value proposition to do so. As it turns out, our students mainly access Course Hero in moments of desperation, when they need resource access. Simply creating large CTAs so that users have no option but to click on them is not great user experience, especially not on the home screen. Moreover, having the same CTAs repeated in a long hamburger menu may cause some users to interact with the top few items but if they don't understand what they are interacting with, they may just drop-off entirely.
    </p>
    <h3>Thinking the Bigger Picture</h3>
    <p>
    I started looking at the same set of friction points differently after comparing our user's wants with what we are executing. Previously, we've implemented solutions targeted at specific problems. However, they didn't fully resolve my initial concerns based on feature validation studies I ran, especially around finding relevant content. Students are still confused. 
    </p>

    <p>
    One possible solution, is to eliminate all those initial clicks students need to go through to find the content they want by surfacing content earlier in the funnel. We could intelligently recommend content to users based on existing information we know about them such as the school they attend or even more specifically, courses they are taking, both information we already collect. Furthermore, we could also promote recently unlocked document so that students can easily access them to study for an upcoming exam. If all goes well, they could come back to unlock a new document for their future exams.
    </p>
    <p>
    By this point, our team had hired a junior designer. The two of us looked through various well-used content-based apps in the market such as Facebook, Instagram, Yelp, Youtube, Evernote, Medium, and Spotify. All of them have one thing in common - easy access to new and old content, what people describe as a content-rich feed.
    </p> 
    <p> We began more seriously exploring a new home screen layout. </p>
    <div class="caption"> Some more designs incorporating a content-rich concept.</div>
    <img class="lazy" data-original="../static/build/images/ch-home-2.png" alt="Homepage Iterations" width="100%"/>
    <p>
    Next, we also began evaluating the navigation design pattern choice - hamburger menu. Our existing stats indicated that the hamburger menu is almost never used (less than 1% of iOS app traffic open it at least once and ~40% on Android). Hamburger menus are a standard navigation pattern for Android but even for Android traffic, 40% seems quite low. During our usability tests, we also notice users' tendency to pull out the hamburger menu specifically for going back to home. Ironically, every CTA that is available on the home screen is readily available in the hamburger menu, which means that users are spending an additional click to access the same CTAs. This is evidence that the hamburger menu is ineffective. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Separately, we have a feature called "My Library" which is designed to help users organize their content into course folders based on the classes they are taking at school. Our initial intention is to provide My Library to students so that they can access those resources they've unlocked. However, the way it is represented throughout the app, is inconsistent. In some places, it is named "My Courses" and others, the content is first broken down by content type (notes, tutor help or flashcards), then by the courses, with no mention of "My Courses", causing more confusion. Some mentioned during our usability test that they thought "My Courses" served as a directory for all courses and content we have in our database but that is not the case. It is also buried at the bottom of the hamburger menu, which further lowers its usage rate. 
    </p>
    <p>
    By this point, I had started designing with a new navigation patterns and rethinking the information architecture on my own, especially with Course Hero vs. students' motivations in mind. I ran an information architecture exercise with other designers where designers paper prototyped their own Course Hero app experience. We iterated on a few different ways to organize the app with navigation patterns such as top tab navigation, bottom tab navigation, a different hamburger menu and a custom navigation. Each design was presented to the product team and eventually, everyone agreed to move forward with an A/B test of the bottom tab navigation design. </p>
    <div class="caption">Navigation patterns we experimented with</div>
    <img class="lazy" data-original="../static/build/images/ch-nav-patterns.png" alt="Navigation patterns" width="100%"/>
    <p>The rationale behind choosing a bottom tab navigation is that 1) it presents a set of finite options to the user early in the funnel (increase memorability) 2) the bottom tabs are almost always available to users without any proactiveness (increase availability) 3) the information architecture made more sense to the users we've concept tested with (improved information architecture). 
    </p>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>
    The A/B test is still underway. However, the progress that was made from a design standpoint set a huge milestone. Design has never been the driver of product decisions in the past at Course Hero due to our business-driven culture. However, we were able to combine business metrics along with some design research to make a compelling argument. This is the first time that a design pattern is expected to heavily influence the growth of a product for us, which is an exciting accomplishment for the entire design team. To measure success, we want to look for several metrics: 1) increased activity on the home screen especially when they initially open the app; this means that users are able to find what they are looking for sooner 2) increased visits to unlocked content 3) increased usage of the new bottom tab navigation and 4) increased visits to My Library screens. If users enjoy their experience with existing unlocked documents, over time we would also expect them to spend more money or upload more content in exchange for more content unlocks.
