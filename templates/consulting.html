        <h4>Objective</h4>
        <p>Create a order management system for warehouse workers to optimize the order fulfillment process</p>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>Two other consultants and I were placed on a project to come up with a business case and prototype a concept to further streamline a standard warehouse management flow. Based on our research, we know that the existing process can be very manual and relies heavily on human judgment. It is usually a fast-paced environment with a lot of moving objects, which means it can be chaotic, dangerous and distracting. Finally, optimizing item pickup route requires experience and forward-thinking, and junior level workers may need additional guidance to become familiar with the warehouse surroundings.</p>

        <p>The final prototype was demoed to my partner and director, and both were very impressed at the user research and level of detail we prototyped our product to address our users' needs. </p>    

        <h3>Other PwC Consulting Experience</h3>
        <p>I worked under the User Experience team delivering applications to clients on both web and mobile platforms, and have also done internal projects on hardwares such as Google Glass and Beacons. Having worked across the entire product development spectrum end-to-end, I have done work in ideation, low to high fidelity mockups designs, code implementation of my designs, and cross-functional collaboration to have those designed features released. Additionally, I also picked up product management responsibilities to drive larger scale projects to completion at higher velocity and product quality. </p>
