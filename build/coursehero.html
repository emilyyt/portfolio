					I joined the company as a mobile designer at the early stage of our mobile product, during which we were catching up to web on our feature implementation. It was also a pivotal period for our design team as we embarked on a major rebranding effort, with Mobile being the first platform to initiate the design overhaul.

						<span>&#8220;</span>beacons can be used in [chaotic] situations to alleviate the stress that comes from the unpredictability of the experience and transform that into a much more efficient and educational one.
					</div>

					<p>My talk was focused specifically on the application of beacons in the hospital setting. Attending doctor's appointments is often a daunting but necessary task as part of our effort to maintain our health. Patients can spend an indefinite amount of time at the hospital looking for the appointment location and sitting in the waiting area. However, beacons can be used in situations as such to alleviate the stress that comes from the unpredictability of the experience and transform that into a much more efficient and educational one. Some use cases that were discussed include indoor navigation, a virtual point-of-interest guide and a newsboard that personalizes the article list based on the user's profile.

					<p>Grace Hopper Conference 2015 was truly an inspiring experience where a community of passionate indivduals come together to learn, share and explore interesting technology topics. I encourage anyone in the field to attend. </p>
