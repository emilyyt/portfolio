			<h1>Stockpile</h1>
			<h2>Online Stock Trading for Adults and Children</h2>
			<div class="work-content">
				<div class="work-detail">
					<p>
					Stockpile is a fintech startup that provides online stock brokerage services to adults and kids. The company also has a gift card product that enable customers to send fractional shares of stocks to their friends and family as a gift.</p>

					<p>I worked as Stockpile's only design resource for about three months, during which I tackled a variety of design tasks ranging from ideation to execution, marketing to user experience to engineering. 
					</p>
					<h3>Homepage</h3>
					<p>Stockpile needed a major homepage overhaul. The visual and UI designs were outdated and there were too many CTAs on the top section of the homepage that could be reserved for a more visually appealing, interactive experience.</p>
					<h4>Project Context</h4>
					<p>We want to evoke a sense of professionalism but also cater to a younger audience to show that stock trading is not an intimidating activity and is accessible to everyone (since we have customers under 18). Based on some analysis, customers have four major use cases when they visit our homepage: 1) They land on our page through organic traffic or ads and want to know what we are about 2) They've received a gift card and would like to redeem it 3) They want to order a gift card for someone else 4) They simply want to open a brokerage account or log into their existing account. I looked into similar product website homepages to draw some inspiration and came up with a couple mocks that fit the mood we were going after.</p>

					<h3>Dashboard</h3>
					<p>The portfolio dashboard is one of the most important and most visited pages for existing account holders. We want our customers to not only get a quick summary of how their portfolio is performing, but also include additional features that can help them make informed decisions about each stock without going through Google or Yahoo Finance.</p>
					<div class="caption">This is the old dashboard.</div>
					<img class="top" src="images/stockpile-dashboard-old.png" alt="Dashboard Portfolio" width="100%"/>
					<p>I researched various dashboard designs online and also look at existing websites that have similar dashboard concepts. A huge selling point for our products was the brand recognition that comes with the gift card purchase - therefore, company branding is an element I incorporated into the design. I explored various ways to utilize companies' logos and color schemes on the page. Overall, I did two major iterations on the design.</p>
					<h4>Iteration 1</h4>
