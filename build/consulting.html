					<p> Note: Due to potential firm policies, I do not post my work online, but please email me if you would like to see a selection of what I can share. </p> 
          <p>In the past two years, I worked under the User Experience team delivering applications to clients on both web and mobile platforms, and have also done internal projects on other hardwares such as Google Glass and Beacons. I have worked across the entire product development spectrum end-to-end, from ideation, creating low to high fidelity mockups, to implementation of my designs in code and collaborating cross-functionally to have the features released. Additionally, I also picked up product management responsibilities to drive larger scale projects to completion at higher velocity and product quality. </p>
